# Interesting Resources

I leave some links that may be of interest to several people. Recently, he tried to be more methodical and take advantage of reading several electronic books to learn different topics.

## Python

* [Sensio - Canal de Python y IA](https://www.youtube.com/c/sensio-ia). Very good YouTube channel where different topics related to data science, use of python, Git, artificial intelligence, among others, are explained. Highly recommended, it is in Spanish language.

## R

* [Inferential Statistic en Ciencia de Datos](https://moderndive.com/). Very good ebook on inferential statistics with several applied cases and easy to understand examples. Highly recommended.
* [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). Ebook about the use of R at a slightly more advanced level. very useful to get more out of it.
* [Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with R](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/). Very good ebook to learn about Bayesian statistics with examples in R.
* [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/). Ebook dealing with various ways on how to increase script performance, memory usage and other similar topics in R.
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/). A very good book about statistical topics in R.
* [A Data.table and dplyr tour](https://atrebas.github.io/post/2019-03-03-datatable-dplyr/). Translation of functions from the dplyr world (tidyverse) to data.table. Data.table is a variable type similar to data.frame, but optimized for working with large amounts of data. When we must work with large amounts of data, dplyr can fall short, so data.table can be a very good option.
* [dtplyr/translation](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/translation.html) If you want to convert code that contains dplyr functions and you need to quickly convert everything to data.table, you can use the dtplyr library to do the conversion quickly and easily.

## Miscellaneous

* [Curso de Docker en espaÃ±ol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZpyvK6UGFo&list=PLqRCtm0kbeHAep1hc7yW-EZQoAJqSTgD-). YouTube channel where basic topics about the use of Docker and its configuration for multiple purposes are explained (it is in Spanish).
* [Making Slides with R Markdown](https://arm.rbind.io/slides/xaringan.html#5). Documentation to learn how to use Sharingan, a useful library to create great presentations in R through RMarkdown.
